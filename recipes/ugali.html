    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>Ugali is a staple of the Kenyan diet, eaten by many on a daily basis. It is generally served as a side - the perfect accompaniment for stews, curries, or veggie dishes.</p>
    <p>If you visit Kenya, don't be surprised to see locals eating ugali with their hands, using it almost like a utensil. The proper way is to pinch a small bit off with your fingers, roll into a ball, and use your thumb to make a small depression for scooping up a bite of stew.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of water</li>
        <li>1-2 cups of medium/coarse-ground white cornmeal</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, and stirring constantly with a whisk, slowly add the cornmeal to the boiling water. The ugali will begin to thicken quite quickly.</li>
        <li>Keep stirring and pressing the mixture against the sides of the pan to break up the lumps.</li>
        <li>The mixture with begin to come away from the sides of the pan.</li>
        <li>Allow it to cook on the low heat for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the ugali from the pan to a plate and then pat it down into a round shape.</li>
        <li>Serve while hot with your favorite stew or curry and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
